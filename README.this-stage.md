# Maru (stage 3)

> **NOTE:** This readme only covers this specific stage of Maru. The full README.md file can be found in the git branch of the latest stage.

## Assorted smaller changes

- a phony define-constant; only to denote the intention for now.
- more sophisticated bootstrap procedure
- several stuff backported from the latest eval.l & co.
