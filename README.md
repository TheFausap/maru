The `piumarta` branch of this git repo is a conversion of Ian Piumarta's mercurial
repo that was once available at http://piumarta.com/hg/maru/. To the best of my knowledge
this is latest publically available state of Ian's work. This branch will be kept as is,
except for small fixes and cleanups that I'll do while exploring it.
