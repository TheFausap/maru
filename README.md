# Maru (stage 1)

> **NOTE:** This readme focuses on the aspects of this stage that are relevant for bootstrapping the next stage. The full README.md file can be found in the git branch of the latest stage.

The `eval.l` file in this stage is the reimplementation of the `eval.c` file of the previous stage,
but this time in (a subset of) Maru. They are mostly mirrors of each other, but written in different languages.

Unsurprisingly, the behavior of the produced executables should be (mostly) the same.
